These are the things I wished someone had told me while trying to become technical enough to start a startup.

1) Start Top-Down, as opposed to Bottom-Up.

The whole point of programming is to build things. "Coding" is just the assembly part, and is an order of magnitude less important than deciding you want to build something. Learning syntax is a waste of time because maybe only 1% of what you're learning will actually be relevant to the project you want to build. 

2) Learn by doing.

I wasted a lot of time cycling through endless videos, books, and freeCodeCamp challenges before I finally heard George Hotz say "You will never learn programming by watching a video called 'learn programming.' The only way to learn programming is to keep pushing on a project." 

3) Google it.

Every question you could possibly have has been answered on Google or StackOverflow. Every single one. It is an infinitely more productive use of time finding the person who already solved your problem than it is for you to try to solve it from scratch.
