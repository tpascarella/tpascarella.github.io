These are the things I wished someone had told me while trying to become technical enough to start a startup.

1. Start Top-Down, as opposed to Bottom-Up.

The whole point of programming is to build things. The way you go about building things is that you have something in the world you want to make, and then try to make it. 

2. Tutorials are a waste of time.

I wasted a lot of time endlessly cycling through endless videos, books, and freeCodeCamp challenges before I finally heard George Hotz say "You will never learn programming by watching a video called 'learn programming.' The only way to learn programming is to keep pushing on a project.'

3. Google it.

Every question you could possibly have has been answered on Google or StackOverflow. Every single one. It is an infinitely more productive use of time finding the person who already solved your problem than it is for you to try to solve it from scratch.
