Y Combinator has many videos on their YouTube channel titled "How to Build the Future." 

The key word here, is **build**. 

You can't change the world if you can't build the thing that will do it. This means that if you are a solo nontechnical founder, it is your responsibility to become technical enough to build/launch/iterate an MVP. These are the things I wished someone had told me while trying to become technical enough to start a startup.

## 1) "Coding" isn't as big a deal as you think.

The whole point of programming is to build things. The "coding" part is merely the assembly portion. It is a means to the end goal of building stuff, and all of the other stuff, which language to learn, which IDE to use, design patterns, are an order of magnitude less important than building what you want. Learning syntax is a waste of time because maybe only 1% of what you're learning will actually be relevant to the project you want to build.

## 2) Learn by doing.

I wasted a lot of time cycling through endless videos, books, and freeCodeCamp challenges before I finally heard George Hotz say "You will never learn programming by watching a video called 'learn programming'. The only way to learn programming is to keep pushing on a project." Once I switched from tutorials to an actual project, I had my MVP launched within a week.

Tutorials will not teach you anything.

Building things will.

## 3) Google it.

Every technical question you could possibly have has already been answered on Google and StackOverflow. 

Every.single.one. 

It is an infinitely more efficient use of your time *finding the person who already solved your problem* than it is to solve everything problem from scratch.

## 4) Write psuedocode first.

The whiteboard is the ultimate test of your programming ability. Pretend like you're the computer and write out the code that will do what you want. Once you do that, then go to your IDE, write it, and test. If it crashes, your thought process was wrong, go to Google and Stack Overflow to figure it out. 

As an extension, it's important to handwrite your psuedocode on a whiteboard. Writing things with your hands requires motor skills, and this activates more regions of the brain. Education researchers have discovered that handwritten notes result in more learning than notes taken on a keyboard.

## 5) Iterate incrementally.

Changes to your code base should be made incrementally. If you make 15 changes to your project, deploy it and the whole program crashes, you have no idea which of the 15 changes caused it to crash. You're not yet technical enough to identify which of the 15 changes caused the crash, and it will result in a lot of unnecessary frustration. The number of times I've needed to delete my repository and create a new app from scratch is embarassing. 

## 6) Invest in tools.

Learning to code is a daunting task in and of itself, so the tools that allow you to do it should make the process as seamless as possible. Get an RGB mechanical keyboard off Amazon, buy a 2nd monitor, get some nice noise cancelling headphones, a fancy gaming chair, and a couple of whiteboards. Anything you can do to make the process easier, more pleasant, and more fun will result in you doing it more, and that's how you improve.

## 7) Don't go at it alone.

Find a friend who is willing to help you, become active on Reddit forums, send LinkedIn messages to people who are doing the things you want to do. Surround yourself (either physically or digitally) with people who will elevate your skills, and you will raise your game to be accepted by the pack. Having **just one person** who believes in you can make the difference between success and failure.

## 8) Never lose momentum.

Every time you code should elevate your skills, ambition, and confidence, even if just by a little bit. The following graph represents this point nicely.

This is a graph showing the viral coefficient of a consumer product. If every user brings in 1.01 new users to the site, you will be in this happy place of compounding exponential growth forever. But if each user only brings in .99, the company will inevitably flatline and die. 

This is just one concrete example of how the tiniest bit more effort compounded over time can make the difference between massive suceess and failure. Learn at least one new thing every time you code, and nothing can slow you down.
