>"Writing is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is." -Guindon

Y Combinator has many videos on their YouTube channel titled "How to Build the Future." 

The key word in that sentence, is **build**. 

You can't change the world if you cannot **actually build** the thing that will change the world. This means if you are a solo nontechnical founder, it is your responsibility to become *technical enough* to build/launch/iterate an MVP. 

Here are some lessons I picked up:

## 1) Sign Up for the Odin Project.

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about) is the best resource I have found to become a full stack developer. 

It's an open source project that "is the coding resource we had when we got started." It lays out the entire path, from nothing up to a job ready coder. It provides structure and direction that you would otherwise have to figure out on your own.

## 2) Learn by Doing.

>"You will never learn programming by watching a video called 'learn programming'. The only way to learn programming is to keep pushing on a project." - George Hotz

I wasted a lot of time cycling through endless videos, books, and freeCodeCamp challenges before I finally switched from tutorials to an actual project. 

Go from this,

to this.

## 3) Google It.

Every technical question you could possibly have has already been answered on Google and StackOverflow. 

Every.
single.
one. 

It is an infinitely more efficient use of your time finding someone who already solved your problem, than to solve everything yourself from scratch.

## 4) Write Psuedocode on a Whiteboard.

The whiteboard is the ultimate test of your programming knowledge! 

Pretend you're the computer and write out code that will do what you want. Once you do that, then go to your IDE, write it, and test. If it crashes, your thought process was wrong, and you can use Google and Stack Overflow to fix it.

As an extension, it's important to write your psuedocode on a whiteboard, or at least with your hand. Writing things out by hand requires motor skills, which activates more regions of the brain. Education researchers have discovered that handwritten notes result in more learning than notes taken on a keyboard.

## 5) Iterate Incrementally.

Changes to your code base should be made one at a time. If you make 15 changes to your codebase, and the whole program crashes, you have no idea which of the 15 changes caused it to crash. 

You're not yet technical enough to identify which of the 15 changes caused the crash, and it will result in a lot of unnecessary frustration. I would just delete the repository and create a new one from scratch. Quite inefficient. 

## 6) Invest in Your Equipment.

Learning to code is a daunting task in and of itself, so the tools that allow you to do it should make the process as seamless as possible. 

Here are some recommendations:
- A nice mechanical keyboard & mouse
- A 2nd monitor
- Noise cancelling headphones
- Blue light glasses
- Comfortable chair

## 7) Don't Go at it Alone.

The graph above represents the viral coefficient of a consumer product. Basically, if every user brings in 1.01 new users, you are in this happy place of exponential growth forever. If it's .99, the company will flatline and inevitably die. This is an extreme, but concrete example how just a tiny bit of extra effort can mean the difference between success and failure.

Having **even one person** who believes in you can make all the difference.

## 8) Imposter Syndrome Won't Go Away For a Very Long Time.

You're gonna feel really stupid every single day for a very long time. Get comfortable with that.
