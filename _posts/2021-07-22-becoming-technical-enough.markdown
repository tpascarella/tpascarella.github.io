Y Combinator has many videos on their youtube channel titled "How to build the future." The key word there is build. You can't change the world if you can't build the thing that will do it, meaning you have to become technical enough to build/launch your MVP in order to get a shot. 

These are the things I wished someone had told me while trying to become technical enough to start a startup.

1) Start Top-Down, as opposed to Bottom-Up.

The whole point of programming is to build things. "Coding" is just the assembly part, and is just a means to the end of building what you want to have built. Learning syntax at the beginning largely is a waste of time because maybe only 1% of what you're learning will actually be relevant to the project you want to build.

2) Learn by doing.

Like I said, I wasted a lot of time cycling through endless videos, books, and freeCodeCamp challenges before I finally heard George Hotz say "You will never learn programming by watching a video called 'learn programming.' The only way to learn programming is to keep pushing on a project." Once I switched from tutorials to an actual project, I had my MVP launched within a week. Build something. Anything! 

"Even if it sucks?" Especially if it sucks.

3) Google it.

Every technical question you could possibly have has been answered on Google or StackOverflow. Every.single.one. It is infinitely more efficient finding the person who already solved your problem than it is for you to try to solve it from scratch. Shamelessly Google every programming question you have.

4) Write Psuedocode first.

Changes to your code base should be made incrementally. If you're testing your build locally and you make even one mistake, the entire thing might crash, and you're not technical enough yet to fix it. If you implement changes one at a time, you are much less likely to break everything beyond repair. The number of times I've needed to just delete my repository and create a new app from scratch is embarassing. 

5) Invest in tools.

Learning to code is a daunting task in and of itself. So you don't want the tools you use to present any more friction than is absolutely necessary. Get a mechanical keyboard off Amazon, buy a 2nd monitor, get some nice noise cancelling headphones, and a fancy gaming chair. Anything you can do to make the process easier, more pleasant, and more fun, the more you will do it. 

6) Don't go at it alone.

Find a friend who is willing to help you, become active on Reddit forums, send LinkedIn messages to people who are doing the things you want to do. Surround yourself, either physically or digitally, with people who will elevate your skills, and you will raise your game to be accepted by the pack.
