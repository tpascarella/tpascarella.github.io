Y Combinator has many videos on their youtube channel titled "How to build the future." The key word there is build. You can't change the world if you can't build the thing that will do it, meaning you have to become technical enough to build/launch your MVP in order to get a shot. 

These are the things I wished someone had told me while trying to become technical enough to start a startup.

1) Start Top-Down, as opposed to Bottom-Up.

The whole point of programming is to build things. "Coding" is just the assembly part, and is just a means to the end of building what you want to have built. Learning syntax at the beginning largely is a waste of time because maybe only 1% of what you're learning will actually be relevant to the project you want to build.

2) Learn by doing.

Like I said, I wasted a lot of time cycling through endless videos, books, and freeCodeCamp challenges before I finally heard George Hotz say "You will never learn programming by watching a video called 'learn programming.' The only way to learn programming is to keep pushing on a project." Once I switched from tutorials to an actual project, I had my MVP launched within a week.

3) Google it.

Every technical question you could possibly have has been answered on Google or StackOverflow. Every.single.one. It is infinitely more efficient finding the person who already solved your problem than it is for you to try to solve it from scratch. 

4) Write Psuedocode first.

Changes to your code base should be made incrementally. If you're testing your build locally and you make even one mistake, the entire thing might crash, and you're not technical enough yet to fix it. If you implement changes one at a time, you are much less likely to break everything beyond repair. The number of times I've needed to just delete my repository and create a new app from scratch is embarassing.
